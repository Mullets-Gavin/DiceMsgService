Utilizing Roblox's Messaging Service, I created a "ping" module which can be used to find a player with a specific UserId & run some executable code thats located at the top of the script. This light weight module allows you to utilize this for things such as a ban system, by banning players in different servers without ever having to join that player! The ideas are endless.

Check out [Dice Ban](https://github.com/Mullets-Gavin/DiceBan) to see an example utilizing this module!

More documentation soon to come
